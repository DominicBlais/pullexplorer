    "body": "This is related to https://github.com/lodash/lodash/issues/2195.\r\n\r\nI have often needed to partition a collection of things based on whether two elements in the collection belong to the same group. Say, for instance, you have a collection of things that are linked to each other one-by-one, so A is connected to C, C is connected to E and B is connected to D. I would like a function that, given A, B, C, D and E, returns two groups: one containing A, C and E and one containing B and D.\r\n\r\nIn other words, it would be very cool if there were like a ‘families’ function accepting two parameters:\r\n- a collection, and\r\n- a predicate of two parameters which, if it returns true, means that those two elements belong to the same group.\r\n\r\nThis would be a generalization of 'partition', in other words: 'partition', when called with predicate 'p', would call 'families' with predicate (x,y) => p(x) == p(y).\r\n\r\nI don't know if 'families' is a good name. I was inspired by Wittgenstein's notion of family resemblance: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_resemblance",
