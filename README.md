# GitHub Pull Explorer

This is just a quick experimental tool for exploring the pull requests of GitHub repositories.
It has not been thoroughly tested and should not be used for any serious purpose.

To use: clone the repo, load the web page at src/index.html in a browser, enter an organization, and select a repo. You may then click on individual pulls for more information.
